# Role Expectations by Position

Detailed breakdown of what each position should be doing at each game phase.

---

## Position 1 (Carry / Safelane)

### Laning Phase (0-10 minutes)

**Primary Objectives:**
- Maximize last hits (target: 60-80 by 10:00)
- Minimize deaths (target: 0-1)
- Secure lane equilibrium with support help

**What They Should NOT Do:**
- Rotate to other lanes
- Chase kills aggressively
- Leave lane to contest runes (unless lane is pushed)

**When to Leave Lane:**
- Lane is completely unplayable (3v1 dive tower)
- Already have key item and can join fights
- Taking tower and rotating to another objective

### Mid Game (10-25 minutes)

**Primary Objectives:**
- Farm dangerous areas with team nearby
- Join fights when key cooldowns are ready
- Hit item timing benchmarks

**Decision Matrix:**
| Situation | Should Join? |
|-----------|--------------|
| 5v5 fight at tower | Yes |
| Skirmish far from farm | Usually no |
| Roshan attempt | Yes |
| Defending high ground | Yes |

### Late Game (25+ minutes)

**Primary Objectives:**
- Be the primary damage dealer
- Never die without buyback
- Position correctly in fights (back line, wait for initiation)

**Critical Mistakes:**
- Getting caught alone (game-losing)
- Using buyback incorrectly
- Fighting without BKB when needed

## Position 2 (Mid)

### Laning Phase (0-10 minutes)

**Primary Objectives:**
- Win or go even in CS
- Control power runes (every 2 minutes starting at 2:00)
- Look for rotation opportunities WITH good runes

**Rotation Triggers:**
- Haste rune → Gank sidelane
- DD rune → Gank or dominate lane
- Invisibility rune → Wrap around for kill
- No rune → Stay mid and farm

**What They Should NOT Do:**
- Rotate without runes (loses too much mid farm)
- Leave lane without pushing wave first
- Die to enemy support rotations

### Mid Game (10-25 minutes)

**Primary Objectives:**
- Create tempo with kills and objectives
- Maintain farm while being active
- Enable carry's farm by pressuring map

**Tempo Heroes vs Farming Mids:**
| Type | Examples | Playstyle |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Tempo | Puck, QoP, Spirit Bros | Fight constantly, take objectives |
| Farming | Invoker, Medusa, Tinker | Farm until timing, then dominate |

### Late Game (25+ minutes)

- Depends heavily on hero
- Some become second carry (SF, Ember)
- Some become utility (Puck, Void Spirit)

---

## Position 3 (Offlane)

### Laning Phase (0-10 minutes)

**Primary Objectives:**
- Get levels (more important than CS)
- Pressure enemy carry
- Force rotations to your lane (create space)

**Success Metrics:**
| Outcome | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| Enemy carry free farms | Failed |
| Enemy carry contested, you survived | Success |
| You died 3 times but carry has 40 CS at 10 | Acceptable |
| You dominated and carry has 30 CS | Excellent |

**What Offlaners Can Do:**
- Die to draw enemy resources
- Pull the hard camp
- Trade aggressively even if they die

**What Offlaners Should NOT Do:**
- AFK jungle when lane is playable
- Feed without purpose (dying without drawing anything)
- Take unnecessary fights before level 6

### Mid Game (10-25 minutes)

**Primary Objectives:**
- Initiate fights for your team
- Build aura items (Pipe, Crimson, Vlads)
- Create space for carry to farm

**Playstyle:**
- Be the frontline
- Make enemy focus you, not your carry
- Push dangerous lanes that carry can't

### Late Game (25+ minutes)

**Critical Role:**
- Initiation (Blink + stun/disable)
- Frontline (absorb spells before carry enters)
- Objective control (zoning during Roshan)

---

## Position 4 (Soft Support / Roamer)

### Laning Phase (0-10 minutes)

**Primary Objectives:**
- Secure lane for offlaner (levels 1-3)
- Rotate for kills (with smoke or through gates)
- Contest power runes
- Stack camps when passing by

**Rotation Priority:**
1. Kill on mid with rune
2. Kill on enemy safelane
3. Defending your safelane carry
4. Stacking for carry

**What They Should NOT Do:**
- AFK sit in lane soaking XP
- Rotate without purpose
- Ignore rune spawns

### Mid Game (10-25 minutes)

**Primary Objectives:**
- Set up kills for cores
- Control vision aggressively
- Enable teamfight initiations

**Item Focus:**
- Mobility (Blink, Force Staff)
- Utility (Spirit Vessel, Solar Crest)
- Situational (Lotus, Glimmer)

### Late Game (25+ minutes)

- Provide utility in fights
- Save items for carry
- Initiation backup (secondary initiator)

---

## Position 5 (Hard Support)

### Laning Phase (0-10 minutes)

**Primary Objectives:**
- Keep carry alive and farming
- Zone enemy offlaner (levels 1-3)
- Pull when lane pushes
- Stack camps
- Place and protect wards

**Priority Order:**
1. Carry survival
2. Lane equilibrium
3. Vision
4. Stacks

**What They Should NOT Do:**
- Take carry's last hits
- Leave carry alone against kill lane
- Die for no reason
- Hoard gold (buy wards, smokes, dust)

**When to Leave Lane:**
- Carry is self-sufficient (level 6+, good matchup)
- Carry asks for solo XP
- Another lane is in crisis

### Mid Game (10-25 minutes)

**Primary Objectives:**
- Maintain vision
- Position behind cores in fights
- Use save items (Glimmer, Force) on cores

**Positioning:**
- Never front of team
- Near but not on top of carry
- Ready to cast spells and items

### Late Game (25+ minutes)

**Critical Responsibilities:**
- Vision around objectives
- Smoke initiation coordination
- Save carry at all costs
- Acceptable to die if carry survives

**Net Worth:**
- Should be lowest on team
- If you have too much gold, you're playing wrong
- Buy team items (Gem, Smokes, Wards)

## Cross-Role Interactions

### Carry + Support Coordination
- Support should know when carry wants solo XP
- Carry should communicate danger areas
- Stack timing communicated

### Mid + Support Rotation
- Pos 4 rotates to mid for rune ganks
- Mid pings before leaving for sidelane
- Support wards for mid's safety

### Offlane + Pos 4 Synergy
- Pos 4 helps secure level 3, then can roam
- Pos 4 returns if offlaner is dying too much
- Communicate when leaving/returning
